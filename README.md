## Purpose of the Website
___

The purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase my skills, as a developer and IT professional, as well as my experience as a graphic designer, to prospective employers.

This website contains samples of my work during my time at Coder Academy as well as graphic design projects created for my clients. It also contains information about myself, my professional experience, my knowledge of programming languages and my blog which narrates the story of my journey from my beginnings as an administrative professional to my new found passion and love for the world of design and web development.

With beginner to intermediate skills in programming, my aim is to continue to build this website as I further develop my skills in web development, and to continue to add elements to my portfolio to create a variety of work examples that I could potentially showcase to my future employers or clients. 

## Functionality, Features & Style Guide
___

The website contains six pages:

1. Home page (index.html)
2. About Me page (about.html)
3. Portfolio page (portfolio.html)
4. Resume page (resume.html)
5. Blog Posts pages (blog.html)
6. Contact Me page (contact.html)

All pages link together throught the main menu which enables the user to navigate throughout the website.

Links to my professional social accounts such as LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram(freelance business accounts) are also made available to the user within the footer of the website

A style guide was established to ensure consistency accross all pages which share a common theme. This also establishes a personal branding style that reflects who I am both at a personal and professional level. By using the style guide I can ensure that the fonts, colours and main graphics remain consistent accross the whole website. My personal branding consists of visual branding with professional photos and my web developer logo. The overall look and feel aims to resonate with my own personality and values.
