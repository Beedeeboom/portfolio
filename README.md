## Purpose of the Website

The purpose of this portfolio website is to showcase my skills, as a developer and IT professional, as well as my experience as a graphic designer to prospective employers.

This website contains samples of my work during my time at Coder Academy as well as graphic design projects created for my clients. It also contains information about myself, my professional experience, my knowledge of programming languages and my blog, which narrates the story of my journey from my beginnings and long term career as an administrative and customer service professional to my new found passion and love for the world of design and web development.

With beginner to intermediate skills in programming, my aim is to continue to build this website as I further develop my skills in web development, and to continue to add elements to my portfolio to create a variety of work samples that I could potentially showcase to my future employers or clients. 

## Target Audience

The website was designed to attract potential employers seeking to employ a developer or IT professional with high expectations of professionalism and a positive work ethic. The target audience would have technical knowledge within the industry of information technology and software development and would expect its prospective employee to have abilities in coding various programming languages and development stacks. The target audience also takes into account its future employee's soft skills, work experience in both programming and other business industries, abilities to adapt to working within a team environment or self directed and flexibiltiy to work on a variety of projects.

All pages of the website can be accessed through the navigational menu at the top of each page. 

Links to my professional social accounts, LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram (my freelance business accounts) are also made available to the user within the footer of the website. 
The idea of also showcasing my freelance business within my portfolio, via my social accounts, aims at demonstrating my skills and ability to manage a small business and my experience with client relationships. I feel this feature is an important aspect to showcasing my experience not only as a web developer but also in other aspects of the working industry which are also invaluable skills that could be benefical to potential employers. 

All pages of the website are produced with a responsive layout that will display on desktop, mobile and tablet devices and have been built for accessibility to all users.

A style guide was established to ensure consistency accross all pages which share a common theme. This also establishes a personal branding style that reflects who I am both at a personal and professional level. By using the style guide I can ensure that the fonts, colours and main graphics remain consistent accross the whole website. My personal branding consists of visual branding (professional photos) and my web developer logo. The overall look and feel aims to resonate with my own personality and values.
